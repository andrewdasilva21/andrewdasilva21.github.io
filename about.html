        <h1>About me</h1>
     This page is a little information about me and my life.<br>
        My name is Andrew DaSilva and I am from cumberland Rhode Island, I attend the University Of Rhode Island and am currently an ECN Major but would like to switch to Computer Science
        Both of my parents are in the computer science department and i have been around it my entire life. It is the only thing that interests me when i think of carrer paths. I like to play video games and sports 
        on my free time. I have one older brother and a dog. When i think of a dream job i think of something like being a professional hacker working for the good side or something like creating programs or websites or even designing video games. I have always had a passion for electronics and how they
        work.
