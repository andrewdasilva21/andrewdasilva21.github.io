        <h1>About me</h1>
     This page is a little information about me and my life.<br>
        My name is Andrew DaSilva and I am from cumberland Rhode Island, I attend the University Of Rhode Island and am currently an ECN Major but would like to switch to Computer Science
        Both of my parents are in the computer science department and i have been around it my entire life. It is the only thing that interests me when i think of carrer paths. I like to play video gaes and sports 
        on my free time. I have one older brother and a dog.
